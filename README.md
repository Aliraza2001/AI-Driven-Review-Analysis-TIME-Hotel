# AI-Driven-Review-Analysis-TIME-Hotel
This repository contains the code, analysis, and report for a project focused on leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze customer reviews for TIME Hotel.

The project aims to provide actionable insights to hotel management by automating the sentiment analysis of online reviews and categorizing negative feedback into specific areas of concern, such as cleanliness, service, amenities, food, and comfort.

Key components of the project include:

Data Acquisition: Web scraping customer reviews from platforms like Google Reviews using tools like lobster.io.

Data Processing: Cleaning and preprocessing the data using Python libraries such as Pandas to handle missing values and standardize text data.

Sentiment Analysis: Utilizing NLP libraries like TextBlob and NLTK to classify reviews into positive, negative, or neutral categories.

Categorization of Negative Reviews: Identifying specific themes in negative reviews to pinpoint areas for improvement.

Data Visualization: Generating visual representations (e.g., pie charts, bar graphs) using Matplotlib and Seaborn to present the results in an easily understandable format.

Feedback Generation: Synthesizing the analysis into actionable recommendations for hotel management to enhance guest satisfaction and operational efficiency.

The project was developed in Python using Google Colab as the primary development environment. The repository includes the code for data scraping, cleaning, sentiment analysis, categorization, and visualization, along with a detailed report summarizing the methodology, challenges, and outcomes.

This project is ideal for those interested in AI, NLP, data analysis, and their applications in the hospitality industry. It demonstrates how AI can be used to transform customer feedback into strategic insights, helping businesses improve their services and customer experience.
